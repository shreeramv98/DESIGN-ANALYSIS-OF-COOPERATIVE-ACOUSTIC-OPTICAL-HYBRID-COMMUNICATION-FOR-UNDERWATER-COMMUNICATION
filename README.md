# DESIGN-ANALYSIS-OF-COOPERATIVE-ACOUSTIC-OPTICAL-HYBRID-COMMUNICATION-FOR-UNDERWATER-COMMUNICATION


ABSTRACT:

Underwater communication is an emerging field of research currently which is an important
aspect in predicting the climatic conditions accurately. Underwater communication
is disadvantageous when compared with aerial communication because water is
basically non transparent and blurred to electromagnetic radiations excluding visible
region. In visible region, factors such as suspended sediments and presence of aquatic
life affects the penetration of light. It may penetrate only upto few hundreds of metres in
clear water and in turbid waters, penetration is even less. Underwater communication is
also affected by multipath fading which introduces Intersymbol Interference (ISI). Currently,
a booming and mature technology called acoustic technology is employed for
underwater communication systems. Acoustic systems are proficient for long distance
communication. But acoustic communication has limitations. They have very low data
rates for monitoring applications and due to velocity of sound in water, it has a huge
latency which means a significant time delay. To cope up with the limitations of acoustic
communication, we use optical communication whose wavelength lies in the visible
region. Optical communication are known for high data rate and low latency. Many
accidents take place under water such as plane crash, ship sinking. It is a tedious job to
find the lost debris. Hence an underwater optical link is developed which could identify
the lost debris. In this project, a hybrid model comprising of acoustic as well as optical
link is proposed. The propagation of data in each technique is studied and simulated by
MATLAB simulation and the responses are plotted. This simulated results can be used
in various applications including climate monitoring, military services.
